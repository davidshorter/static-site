Today was a pretty chill day in Bologna. Being that it was Liz's birthday, we didn't want to go overboard. We slept in, and had a leisurely breakfast in the apartment. We then decided to head out to the old part of Bologna's city center to see some sights. Bologna had a different feel than the previous cities we visited. It seemed more medieval in a way, without the same flourishes that we had seen in other larger cities. We started the day on the town with a visit to [Osteria dell'Orsa] (http://www.osteriadellorsa.com/), which was a recommendation from our host Marco. It was fabulous. We ordered the daily special, which was tagliatelle with a bolognese ragu. The entire meal (2 pasta dishes, 2 drinks etc) cost us about 17â‚¬. It was almost like stealing, but it was a very cafeteria style restaurant. It was jam packed with young adults, and there was a 1/2 hour wait just to get in. Still well worth it. After lunch, we tootled around the Bologna towers. Liz challenged me to climb the tower, and we did. It was 498 steps to the top, with an elevation gain of 88 meters. The views from the top were well worth it. Liz went inside a few churches, but as I was wearing shorts, I stayed outside. We called it a day pretty early, as we had to get up and clean the apartment for our checkout the next morning. We also had a bunch of banking etc, to do online, so we just called it an early night, and hung around the apartment.
