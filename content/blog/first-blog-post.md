Hello! This is the first post on the blog.

Still working on site navigation and templating, but all seems to be in order. I will be using this blog during our Europe trip to upload images and such. We fly out of Calgary tonight at 9PM direct to Heathrow. Our bags are packed, and we will undoubtedly find some sort of shenanigans to get into shortly. Hopefully one or two of my friends and/or coworkers decides to read this blog, as I don't want to be constantly spamming social media with daily updates. This blog also allows for offline editing, so I can update the live version when I get a stable internet connection.

Will post again tomorrow.

-Dan
