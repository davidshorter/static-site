Today was the day. Lamborghini here we come. We slept in again, being that nights on proper beds are hard to come by. We spent some time during the morning preparing, looking up bus routes, etc, as it would take 2 busses to get to the museum. Both busses took about an hour, but we ended up making it with the assistance of a picture-perfect Italian grandma giving us directions. The Lamborghini factory is in Santa Agata Bologna, which is a town that barely has electricity. It was old school, but took great pride in the factory. While we were walking to and from the bus stop, Ferraris, Aston Martins, Beamers, and Lambos tore down the main highway. The Lamborghini museum was fairly small, with probably about 30 vehicles in total. We did not opt for the factory tour, as Liz would not have enjoyed a very expensive tour of robotic machinery building cars. She did seem to like the museum, as it focused more on the history of the brand, rather than just a showcase for new cars (although there were some). Some vehicles to note: There were a bunch of concept cars, a countach with chassis #001, and bare engines to showcase the design. Liz particuarly liked the Lamborghini 350GT, which was the car that brought Lamborghini to the international stage, and the Urus, the SUV scheduled for production in 2018. We spent about 2 hours in the museum then headed home. We made dinner, and spent the rest of the night doing online banking, and planning for the next leg of the trip.
