+++

Today was another travel day. We parted ways with Catherine early in the morning to catch our 10AM flight to Geneva. She commented that most take the train, but we didn't want to deal with trains during the holiday weekend. Airports always run. We managed to find our carshare, and successfully made it from the Geneva Airport to Annecy for 8€ (To put it in perspective, the taxi from the airport to Annecy would have been 80€). Once in Annecy, we met up with our host for the weekend. He is a college student in Annecy, and was super friendly. We went to the grocery store, picked up food, and cooked dinner. Baguette, sausage and salad. All over a 1.50€ bottle of wine. We didn't have any plans today, other than getting to the apartment, and getting groceries. We will be touring Annecy tomorrow, and will have photos. Weather was about 25C and full sun. It was almost 27C on the sidewalk downtown.

Bon Soir!
