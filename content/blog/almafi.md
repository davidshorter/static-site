title = "Almafi Coast"

+++

Today started late, as we slept in late. We had been going non-stop for days, and wanted to spend the morning in bed snoozing, and surfing the web :D. We Hopped in the car at about 1-ish, and set out on the road. It took about an hour to get to the Almafi coast from the mainland side, but it allowed us to drive the coast as a loop. The Almafi coast was beautiful, and had many views that were breathtaking. Unfortunately, the drive is treacherous (see my Naples driving rundown, then imagine tour buses driving like that on a single lane [aka one way] wind-y mountain road). I am pretty sure that the only place on earth with crazier driving would be China or Japan. Seriously. This meant that there are no pictures to show, as parking would have been crazy, and we decided to just drive the coast and call it a day. We went out to a Pizzaria near the Pompeii ruins, for some authentic pompeii pizza. The pizza was ok, but not amazing. We kept the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Again, no pics due to the crazy driving conditions.
