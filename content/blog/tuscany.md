Well, today started off poorly to say the least. Our accommodations were lacking, although not visibly. We had a terrible night sleep. There were a few of reasons for this:

* I swear there must have been a frat house/bar district/college campus on our block. People were screaming, cheering, whistling, yelling, crying, laughing, singing, and all other sorts of hooliganisms till the wee hours of the night. Loudly to the point that they could be heard through earplugs, through closed windows, and blocks away.

* There was a torrential downpour, that made me wonder if it was going to wash away the cars parked on the street.

* The bed in the apartment was actually a fold out couch, that creaked LOUDLY whenever you decided to take a breath, let alone wiggle, move your arm, etc. For those who have sleeping partners, you know that this sort of loud squeak leads you to want to murder someone by 2AM.

For these reasons, we woke up unhappy to say the least. Our outlook was about to improve. I had booked a Tuscan wine tour of the Sienna valley, and this was the day. We walked down the street to the tour office, and checked in.

We started the tour with a drive to a medium sized vineyard: [Tenuta Torciano] (http://www.torciano.com/EU/cantina/), where we started off with a bunch of wine, oils, and snacks, while the staff entertained! the weather was great, and this made it a great experience. We then took a trip to the second vineyard (sorry I can't remember the name!), where we got a tour of a small winemaking establishment. We got to see the presses, the cellars, the vats etc. We sampled some wine, and had bruschetta. Was pretty good too! The tour finished up by stopping for an hour or so in the town of San Gimignano, where I had an epic 3 scoop gelato cone, with probably the most epic gelato I have ever had. With that, the tour bus brought our wobbly butts back to Florence.

We had a quick nap on the squeaky couch, then hit the road again for dinner. We found a great little place outside of a large cathedral (not the Duomo), where I was able to have Papardelle with Wild Boar. Delicious. We were less than thrilled about going back to the apartment for the night, but we were quite tired, so we did anyways ;)
