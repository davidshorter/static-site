Today was eventful! We started the day off by a train ride to the Tour d'Eiffel. Upon arrival, we decided to forgo the 40â‚¬ ticket price to take the elevator to the top. Although it would have been a fabulous view, we decided to pace ourself with our spending. We walked from the Eiffel Tower down the Sienne to the Isle de la Citie. We grabbed lunch (ham and cheese grilled sandwich!) on the way, as Liz was hungry. After lunch we continued walking and visited the Notre Damme, and saw the windows. Although there was an option to climb the belltowers, the couple hundred people in line dissuaded us. There weren't too many tears once Liz remembered that the other island was known for it's ice cream. One Honey Nougat ice cream cone later, we were back on our walk. We figured that it would be easier to walk back to Catherine's as there were no direct metro lines.

Still working on getting pictures working in the blog. Hopefully I can get them up and running soon. I want to tap into the theme JS library for the cool thumbnails and overlays. Shouldn't be too hard...
