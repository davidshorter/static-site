+++

Today was a bit of a hectic day. We started off by having breakfast at the B&B, which turned out to be a modern traditional Italian breakfast: toast and coffee. We packed out of Mestre, and took the train to Venice proper. A whopping 2.60â‚¬ for both tickets combined. A quick train ride, and we were in the Venice station. We were met by our host at the station, and given a quick tour on the way back to the apartment (we were airbnb'ing again). We were fed a coffee, and we packed our bags into our room, and headed out into Venice to explore. We ended up going all the way to San Marco Square, and all the way back to the station. It ended up being a 5-6 hour walk, and we toured the outside of the entire city. We were not expecting to go so far or so long, and we didn't bring our cameras etc. We came back to the apartment, tired, and with sore feet. We slept for a couple hours, then headed out for dinner. We ended up getting lost after dinner, mostly from trying to find our way home in the dark!

I have combined the choice Venice photos with the next days, to avoid too many similar looking duplicates.
