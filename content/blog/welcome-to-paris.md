Today was a long and a short day all in one. The flight to Heathrow was a long flight, and luckily we were seated in the last row before the bathrooms. Liz was quite happy not to have to go far. we arrived in London at about 2PM local time, and we had a pretty uneventful layover for an hour or so. The flight from London to Paris was short, but full of kids who seemed to be pretty novice flyers. Good thing there were barf bags. We got into Paris at about 5PM, and found out how the Metro worked. We took the train from the airport, and after a few transfers, ended up in the 13th. We followed the directions given by Catherine, and found her place without issue. She greeted us happily, and fed us dinner. Traditional french bread/cheese/cold cuts! She gave us a rundown of what to see/what to avoid when touring the city. We called it a night quite early (8-ish) but we had been going for so long, that we didn't mind.

All in all, a pretty good day of flying. Even though we slept most of it :D

Tomorrow will bring more excitement!
