The day started out early, with us thanking our host and hostess for their hospitality over the past few days. The weather was pouring rain. This was the first time during the trip that we were really thankful that we invested in proper rain gear not only for ourselves, but for our backpacks (yes, they make backpack raincovers, and yes, it is serious business). We walked to the train station, and purchased tickets from Venice to Verona. 20â‚¬ later, we had our 2 biglietti (tickets), and were seated on the train. It was a quick ride, being only about an hour. we got off the train to find our hotel. We had some loosely translated instructions on how to walk to the hotel, and these were questionable at best. It was only a 20 minute walk, and as it turned out, there were many road signs leading to the hotel, so our concerns were eased. We checked in early, and ate lunch in the trattoria at the main floor of the hotel. It turned out to be a themed trattoria, with the theme being american movie hits. There were Marilyn Monroe posters, Elvis posters, The Matrix posters, etc. Again, the European fascination with american pop culture. We cleaned up after lunch, and had long hot showers. This was the first time in the trip we had complete privacy and autonomy. We proceeded to walk to the "old town" of Verona. Liz wanted to see Juliets house, and we did. Quite a tourist hotspot. We ate dinner at a pizzaria across from the Arena, so that we would not miss the night's show. And what a show it turned out to be. 2Cellos did an amazing job and entertained the entire crowd. Many times during the performance, the whole crowd was standing, rocking out, and singing along to the classic rock tunes. Definitely a highlight of the trip so far. A short walk home after the show took us back to the hotel for the night.

Liz took the photos in Verona, so you will have to check Facebook under her account for them.
