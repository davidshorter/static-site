What a day. Today started a little bit later (10AM), as we didn't plan anything in the early morning. Our day started off with a metro ride to the Arc de Triumphe. After chuckling at tourists taking selfies in the middle of the 8 lane road, we met Serge for lunch. He took us to a lovely restaurant that served smoked salmon as a specialty. Although Canadian smoked salmon is a thing, this was incredible, as it was almost sashimi. We were joined by Catherine and Jean, and proceeded to walk down the Champs d'Elysees. It was about 25C and sunny, so it was a lovely walk. At the end of the Champs is the Louvre. Having purchased tickets the night before, we were able to walk in. We spent about 3 hours in the Louvre (until closing), seeing many, many classic pieces (yes, including the smirking lady). We got the most joy out of the Egyptian sarcophagi collection, and the french sculpture section (Neptune, Artemis, Hercules, Persephone etc). On the way back to Catherine's, we stopped in at a shopping mall, and noticed how highly the French regard American brands.

Tomorrow morning is our flight to Geneva, so it is an early night tonight.
