Today started off innocently. We got up, had a quick shower, and packed our gear out of the hotel. We had a fairly early train to catch (11:30AM), and we didn't want to miss it. We also had to get to the station early to purchase tickets, as we were taking a high-speed train, and these use assigned seating. We arrived on time, purchased our tickets, only to find out that our train was going to be 45 minutes late. This was not going to be a huge deal, because we had planned for wiggle room on the other end of our train ride. We found out later that the train was delayed due to technical issues, and it was only capable of going 250km/h instead of its usual 300. This meant that our 3 hour train ride became 3:15, and we ended up getting into Napoli almost an hour later than expected. This put us in at almost 4PM. We got out of the train station, and we oriented ourselves with our route to the airport (where our car rental pickup was stationed). Within about 5 minutes of the walk, we knew something was up. For those that are unaware, Naples is a slum. Garbage was everywhere, sidewalks, streets, anywhere and everywhere. The streets and sidewalks are also jammed with cars that are completely beat to shit. I'm not talking about little bumper scuffs, I'm talking missing mirrors, doors with dents that you could fit a soccer ball into, missing fenders entirely....It looked like every vehicle had been used in a demolition derby. Liz quoted me saying "Naples is the city of garbage and fucked up cars" and "I will give you $20 if you can spot a car that I WOULDN'T take to a body shop for repairs". This brings us to our last point about Naples. Driving is on a whole other level. Our tour guides and books warned us not to drive in Naples, and we discovered why. Driving laws are suggestions. Literally. During our 1 hour walk to go rent our car, we saw the following:

* Vehicles doubling the speed limit, on the wrong side of the road
* Vehicles backing up out of alleys across 2 lanes of traffic on a 4 lane road during rush hour
* Vehicles driving on the wrong side of the road constantly
* Vehicles carrying more passengers than designed (4 people on a moped)
* Seat belts seemed to be non-existent, and we saw babies being held in vehicles while driving
* We saw a dude carrying a 40lb propane tank on his lap on a scooter
* Motorcycles/mopeds/scooters do not occupy lanes. They drive between vehicles, or in oncoming traffic
* Lanes are optional, as in naples there are no lane lines marked
* One way streets are suggestions, and often are used as 2 way
* Sidewalks are used for parking, not walking
* Crosswalks are also used for parking
* Curbs mean nothing, and are often driven over. Most vehicles have the bottom of the panels torn off due to this
* Stop signs are often ignored, as they inconvenience drivers
* Yield signs do not exist in Naples, faster moving vehicles have the right of way

After observing these driving patterns, I was thrilled to rent a Manual Transmission Vehicle (after not driving one for a year), and to get into traffic. I laughed, as the rental shop had a "Guide to driving in Italy for international drivers". We went through each point in the guide, and recounted a scenario in the last hour where we saw the "law" being broken. The attendant sheepishly admitted that driving in Naples was not like it appears on paper. We pulled out of the car rental shop, and after about 5 minutes of driving, Liz asked me if this is what Grand Theft Auto was like. Her question was valid. I thought after driving for almost 10 years that I had seen some shit. Then I drove in Naples, and I SAW some shit.

We arrived in Pompeii (where we were staying) at almost 7PM. We were almost 2 hours later than we were supposed to check in, but we did the best we could. Our host was most gracious about letting us in, and told us that it was fine that we were a little late. The apartment that we rented is big and spacious, and has a nice big new kitchen. After an hour of driving in Naples and area, I was done driving for the day. We walked down the road to buy groceries, and we came back home, made dinner, and went to bed.

No pictures, as our delays and driving were not picture friendly.
