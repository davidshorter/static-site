We got up today feeling like death. Another sleepless night due to intense partying and screaming etc outside our window. Apparently there is no "quiet time" for these people at night. The partying went on until about 2-3AM. There were groups of men singing drinking songs, and the like. How this is legal, I don't know.

We left the apartment, happily to find another abode. We checked out at about 10AM, eager for our next accommodation. We strolled around the Duomo, and explored around the Ponte Veccio area. We made our way into south Florence, and walked up a winding road to our next hotel.

The Villa Cora was quite impressive. We walked through the front gate, past an impressive Ferrari to the doorman. The doorman asked if we could help us, and we said that we were checking in. He looked puzzled, and asked if we were on "The List", and was even more surprised when we were! The staff inside were equally as confused when the doorman ushered us inside, and asked if we needed any water or snacks, etc.  We politely declined, and proceeded to check in with the Manager. He was very polite, and was quite understanding. He showed us to our room, and we were so happy to see it. It was a beautiful room with paintings, and intricate crown mouldings, and marble everywhere. Liz took the first opportunity to take a bath, and I took a nap. It was the first good bit of sleep I had in days.

After the long nap, we walked around the Hotel grounds. They were well manicured, with blooming roses everywhere. The main lobby was intricately gilded and painted. We headed back down to the old town center to find dinner. We stopped off at another hole in the wall, for some more wild boar and pasta ;)

we called it a day early again, as we were fully exhausted.
