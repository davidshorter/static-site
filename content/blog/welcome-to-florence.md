+++

We checked out of the apartment in Bologna, and headed to the train station. We were taking one of the high speed trains from Bologna to Florence. We got on the train, and met a family from Spokane, WA, that were travelling with a similar timeframe. Nice people. During the train ride, the train reached 300km/h with ease. There was no real pulling or lurching. When we passed through tunnels, your ears popped from the air pressure change. It was really cool, and extremely quiet. Quite a difference to air travel, and due to the no-stupid-airport-security, I will try to train whenever possible from now on. We arrived in Florence at about 1PM. We walked to our AirBnB, and waited for our host. We were a few minutes early, so we didn't mind the little bit of a wait. However, 5 minutes went by, 10, 20....we were getting concerned that we would not have a place to stay. Eventually, 25 minutes later, the hostess let us in, and showed us the apartment. It was pretty tiny (about 150 square feet), but it had the amenities needed. With some simple instructions, she left us to it. Immediately, we tossed our bags down, and headed straight back to the station. We were taking a day trip to Pisa, and wanted to make sure we made our train (shocker, we did). We arrived in Pisa after about an hour-long train ride, that went without issue. We walked through Pisa to get to the tower. Oh boy, you do not get the scale of the "lean" from the pictures. You see it leaning, and you think to yourself "Damn, someone is getting fired for that". We got some cool shots of Liz, and we continued on walking around the town. We went to go pick up tickets for the cathedral etc, but they were sold out for the day by the time we got there. Despite this, we still thought our day was well worth it. We left Pisa at about 5, and grabbed a snack as it was too early for dinner. We took the train back to Florence, and tried to stop off at the restaurant across the street from the apartment. Unfortunately it was a foody establishment, and was not quite what we were looking for. We eventually wandered around, and stopped off at a hole in the wall that was pretty non-descript. Liz had gnocci, and I had tagliatelle with a ragu (again!). I ordered a Negroni (we were in Florence after all!), and it was delicious. We made our way back home to bed, as we were exhausted.
