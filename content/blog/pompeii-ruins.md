Many people insisted that we visit the ruins of Pompeii, and it was indeed on my bucket list of things to do. Today was going to be sunny and 22C, so we packed up our camera and water bottles, and headed down to the main archeological site. Pompeii was quite an experience. There were large numbers of houses, and villas, each with their own story to tell. We likened this to the Louvre, where there are thousands of pieces, each with a story. You could spend months in the archeological area, and not see everything. We spent about 4 hours viewing the sections that we wanted to see. We walked home, and had a long nap. We were quite tired still from our travels the day before. We got up, and walked to the new downtown to do our laundry (most places we stayed at did not have laundry facilities). About an hour and a half later, our laundry was done, and we trekked back home. We made dinner (fresh pasta with pesto, and pork chops), and went to bed.
