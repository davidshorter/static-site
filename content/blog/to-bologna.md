+++

The day started with us sleeping in. We had nothing scheduled to do in Verona until our train at noon. Being that this was the first night we had slept in a proper bed since we left Edmonton, we were more than happy to sleep in. Up till now, it had been futons and fold outs. Not a big deal, but nice to have a full bed again. We showered, and cleaned up, and again headed out to the train station. We took the train from Verona to Bologna, which was about a 2 hour ride. We arrived in Bologna to a tropical hailstorm lasting a whole 15 minutes. We were concerned that we would have to equip our rain gear, but the rain and hail stopped as quickly as it had started. We walked from the train station to the local bus stop, and took the recommended bus to our next apartment. Marco the host, met us there, and was more than helpful. Being a graduate student at the local university, he was pretty approachable, and had a good sense of humour. The apartment had been newly renovated, and looked like the ikea catalog. Liz was in heaven. Once we dropped our bags, I wanted to have a nap, but got voted off the proverbial island. "You can't always have naptime" she said. "NOOOOOO" I said. So we went to do errands, We stopped off at a local bakery and bought fresh pasta (tortellini and tagliatelle) and pastries. We then walked down the road to the supermarket, to buy the rest of our groceries. Marco gave us the heads up back in the apartment that the supermarket had a laundromat inside, so we had brought our laundry along. Nothing like fresh clean clothes after backpacking for days. We carried our groceries back to the apartment, made dinner, and called it an early night.

No pictures of the laundromat ;)
