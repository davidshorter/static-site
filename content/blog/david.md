We got up today at 8:30, and got cleaned up. we got our bathing suits on, and hit the pool. It was an edgeless pool, and it was glorious. It seemed like no one had been in the pool in days though, as the water was mirror smooth. We swam and lounged around the pool for an hour or so before going back to the room to have a shower, and get packed up. Our checkout was quick, and the doorman insisted that we take a couple of bottles of chilled water and some candies for our walk (they probably don't get many backpackers ;) ). We graciously accepted, and strolled off the grounds well rested and cleaned up.

We stopped off for lunch at the local market that was down the road from the main train station. It had the freshest pasta, and lunch sized to-go plates of pasta were being sold for really low prices out of the back of the bakery. We grabbed 2 plates of pasta, and ate them on the steps of the market before heading to our next hotel. This hotel was only a 2 star hotel, but the bed was large enough, didn't squeak, and there were enough amenities to satisfy us. We plopped our bags down in the room, and headed out to the Uffuzi Gallery. Liz had pre-booked tickets, so the wait was non-existent. We saw a bunch of paintings and Icons, and we saw the bunch that we really wanted to see (especially Venus).

We got through the Uffuzi quicker than we expected, and Liz wanted to see the Academia gallery. We waited in line for about half an hour (which was 1/2 to 1/3 as long as we were told to expect), and got tickets. We saw David, as this piece was one of the first pieces you encounter in the gallery. We saw a bunch of other plaster sculptures, and watched a video on how marble sculptures were carved based on these plaster casts. The Academia Gallery was much smaller, and we only spent about an hour or so looking around. Despite this, we felt that we got our value from the tickets, as we saw what we came to see.

We ate dinner at a place down the road from our hotel, and the food was mediochre. Liz was not too happy with her gnocci, and my pasta was not very exciting, but still good. We closed the night out early, as we had been doing a lot of walking during the day.
