Well, today was an interesting day. It began early, with a 7AM wake up, to make sure that we were able to pack up our gear, and head out to our bus stop. The bus to Sevrier (where BoM was being held) arrived at 8:30, and because it was sunday, it would be the last bus that would get us to the event center before the event started.

The 10 minute bus ride was quick, and cost us a combined 2€, so we couldn't complain. We arranged with the Tournament Organizer to have our bags stored behind the scenes, so they were out of the way. I purchased the event playmat (which is quite pretty, being painted by a famous 19th century Annecy painter), and began to prepare for the tournament. Here is my tournament rundown:

Round 1:

I was paired against a mentor player. He was playing the esper version, not sylvan. Game 1 I got a pretty early ankh and triskelion, but ended up taking a lot of damage in the process. The final turn I was at 2 life, with my opponent at 3 with a mentor, and one monk token on the board. I tapped out to play a triskelion, and hoped it would stick for the win. It did. Game 2 went much quicker, as I got the nut draw, and attacked him with hangarback and ravager while he durdled playing preordain and gush.
 1-0

 Round 2:

 I was paired up against an Eldrazi player. Not eldrazi MUD, no workshops. Game 1, he mulled, scryed, and looked at me. He said "you look like a control player", and scryed the card to the bottom. He lead with a Mimic off an ancient tomb. I then proceeded to waste, strip, thorn, and then hangarback him out of the game. He was quite amused, as he told me that the card he scryed to the bottom was Null Rod, and that he had a second null rod that was stuck unplayable in his hand. Game 2 was a much slower game, as he lead with city of traitors into mimic, then I went hangarback ravager off shop and moxen. Thought-not seer took my jitte, and then the game started to go long. My hangarback kept him from attacking, and he proceeded to start amassing mana sources. He landed a crucible, and I followed up with a sideboarded Ensnaring bridge. This locked the board. I kept 3 cards in hand, and attacked with my hangarback. He blocked with the TNS, and I got the tokens. I then dropped a workshop, and a thorn of amethyst to the board, keeping the limit for creatures at 1 due to the bridge (all his creatures were 2+). He dropped an eye of ugin, and passed. I swung for 3 (he was at 6) with the flying tokens, and played another land to keep the bridge at 1. He searched with ugin, and grabbed World Breaker. I finished the game at about 18 life. Talking to him after the game, he said that Worldbreaker was his only finisher, and that he didn't have spaghetti or ulamog to exile the bridge.

 2-0

 This is where my luck turned around.

 Round 3:

 Round 3 started with a Deck check, which I didn't have any objection to. Unfortunately, my hand written decklist was missing a card (mana crypt), and was a 59 card decklist. This lead to a game loss. I couldn't complain, as the decklist was written by me only, and I had noone to blame but myself. Unfortunately I was down a game, and couldn't sideboard (even though I didn't really want to) I opened with hangarback, and my opponent dropped Rest in Peace. I played ravager, and he played Energy field. I proceeded to drop 5 or 6 creatures over the course of the next few turns, but he tutored for Helm, and finished the match. I told my opponent that I had no way to answer RIP/Flux/Helm, and that I was glad to get my Deck Check game loss in that match. He was amused.

 2-1

 Round 4:

 Round 4 was a tough round, because I got paired up against another shops player. Game 1 I landed Ravager jitte turn 1, then proceeded to draw absolutely nothing for the rest of the game. My opponent drew about 20 cards off of clamp + ravager + hangarback. Game 2 went longer, with me attempting to triskelion his ravager into surgical extraction, but it got misstepped. I should have seen it coming, as he was running city of brass. He played a few nature's claims, and wittled me down with triskelions. He was a good player, and he agreed that I got some really unlucky draws. Either way, the clamp deck is just faster than the ravager deck. He felt that it had better game against non-mentor, whereas my build was straight up mentor killing.

 2-2

 Round 5:

 Round 5 started with my intention of conceding and dropping. This was not due to my play, but the fact that we had to walk back to Annecy at the end of the round to catch our carshare to Geneva. I didn't tell my opponent, because I wanted to get some good games. Game 1 lasted 5 turns. I dropped hangarback for 3 turn 1, he dropped mox orchard. I wasted his orchard, and played triskelion, swung for 3. He dropped another orchard and passed. I wasted his next orchard, and swung for 7. Dropping the 2nd triskelion prompted a concession. Game 2 went just as quickly. He turn 1 Orchard, oath. I turn 1 dropped cage, after attacking with the token. Upkeep, with the oath trigger on the stack, he claimed my cage, and I conceeded. Game 3 went longer, with both sides back and forthing, but he got time vault out, I revoked it. Eventually, he claimed the revoker, after playing key. He took all the turns, and won with a large black non-legend creature (as I had karakas out).

 2-3 (Drop)

 That was my run at Bazaar-of-moxen! Great games, with some really good decision trees. The language barrier was much smaller than I thought it would be, as many of the vintage players have been playing the game for 15+ years, and most speak enough english to play the whole game with english words (respond, stack, trigger, damage, etc). I think that shops was a bit underpowered, but I was not going to swap decks less than a month before the event.

 We left the event to walk back to Annecy, and it was sunny, and warm (probably about 25C/27C in the sun). We made it back to the meeting point for our ride share, and waited for our driver to arrive. 30 minutes after we were supposed to be picked up, we get a text from our driver telling us that she was going to be about 2 hours late due to traffic. This was super frustrating, because we left BoM at 4 to get to Annecy for 5, to take this carshare. We then were supposed to drive for an hour to get to the airport for 6, which got us to the airport well before the 8:30 we needed to make our check-in. A 2 hour delay from 5:30 would have us barely making it. Our driver eventually cancelled on us, and advised that we take alternate transportation. At 6PM on a Sunday, we found ourself in the need to get to Geneva pronto. No busses run that time, nor do trains. The whole reason that we planned to carshare was the fact that public transit didn't run. Missing the flight would mean that we would forfeit our night in Mestre, and our Geneva flight was non-refundable or transferrable. It would cost about 150€ to book new flights at 10PM the next day. Basically, we needed to get to Geneva. We called a bunch of cab companies, and by 7PM eventually found a driver willing to take us. Sebastien drove like a boss, and got us to the airport at 7:45. We tipped him well, as it was mother's day (a civic holiday), and he charged us less than advertised. We made our flight, and took the flight from Geneva to Venice (Marco Polo Airport).

 We had to walk through the sketchiest industrial section of Mestre to get to our B&B. Liz was happy that I brought my knife with me, as she felt a bit better with it. We got lost trying to find the B&B, eventually a local helped us find it (at midnight). It seemed pretty sketchy, being a southeast asian styled B&B. However, reviewing the next morning, it seemed much better.

No pictures from today, as card tournaments and taxi rides do not make great photos.
