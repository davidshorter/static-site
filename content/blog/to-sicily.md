We got up a little bit early today, as we had to clean the apartment before checking out. We packed the food that we wanted to take with us, and piled back in the car. We drove to the Naples airport to check the car in early. After some confusion regarding refilling, we managed to get everything taken care of, and returned without too much issue. We waited around the Naples airport for about 6 hours until our Sicillian flight. It sounds boring, and it was, but we didn't have much more we wanted to do. Our flight to Sicily was just as uneventful, with us landing and going to pick up our car. Unfortunately, today was a Canadian Bank Holiday, which meant that the Visa deposit from earlier in the day did not clear before I needed it for the new rental. Oops. Outside of that, we managed to find the traffic route to our next apartment without too many tears. Google maps was pretty good, but the Sicillian residential areas are very convoluted and twisted. Our host was very friendly, and we basically went straight to bed.
