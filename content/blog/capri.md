Much anticipated, our day trip to Capri was chosen on a perfect day. 24-27C, and full sun. We got up fairly early (7:30AM), and had breakfast, and verified the weather. We did not want to go to Capri if the weather was going to be poor. We piled into the car, and drove down to Sorrento, and parked the car in a garage (as we did not trust street parking). we walked down to the pier, and bought tickets for the 9:45AM ferry to Capri. We got on, and took bets as to who would get seasick. Small boats make Liz sick, and big boats make me sick. Turns out Liz lost :( Luckily for her the ferry ride was only 30 minutes long, and she was able to recover on land before she made a mess. We got off the dock, and it was a 5 minute walk to the main public beach. One thing that we noted from our research is that the beaches in Capri are rocky, not sandy, so we were prepared, unlike some other tourists that were not impressed by this finding. We spent hours on the beach, swimming, sunbathing, eating our picnic lunch that we packed. We stuck on the beach till about 1PM, and then packed up to explore the island a little more. We climbed up to the main town of Capri (which is in the middle of the island, at the top of the cliffs), and took some awesome pictures on the way. We then walked down a bit on the other side of the island (which was the "rich side"), and checked out the hotels and restaurants on the way. Once we were content, we headed back to the pier, and came home. Nothing exciting about the ferry ride or the drive home. Once home, we made dinner and did some chores, and called it a night.

Turns out when taking photos of the ocean, it is really really important to ensure that the horizon is level in your photos. Getting a great shot with a non-level horizon is a real bummer. Lost about 20 photos due to this :( Hoping to be able to photoshop the horizon back to level when I get home, to try and save them. Still got at least two or three frame-able shots, even if I can't save the others.
