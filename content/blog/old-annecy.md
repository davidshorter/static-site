Old town Annecy was a real treat to visit. The "new downtown" was full of teenagers, and young adults, but did not have any flavor or appeal. The old sector was quite different. Old town Annecy is known as the "Venice of the Alps" for its canals, and bridges. The difference here, is that the canals are freshwater, being fed from the lake. The Old town was also filled with all sorts of bakeries, pasteries, and other specialty establishments. Our first stop of the day was [Magic Bazar](http://www.magicbazar.fr/), as they are hosting the [Bazaar of Moxen](http://www.bazaar-of-moxen.com/en/index.html). The staff was quite friendly! I was amused by the assortment of north american playmats for sale. We walked through the Old town for the rest of the morning. We returned to the appartment for an afternoon siesta and shower. We ventured out for dinner at about 5PM, eager to find something "french" to eat. We wandered for about an hour around the town, but ended up returning to a restaurant that we spotted on the way into the sector. Their daily special was "Moules frites maison", which was a fresh pot of mussels (almost 2lbs) and fries. We had that, and a Tartiflette, which was a traditional bacon/potato/cheese casserole. We waddled home stuffed, to get ready for tomorrow.
