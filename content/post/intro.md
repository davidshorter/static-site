Welcome to my website. Although it may seem simple and straightforward, it possesses some interesting features that will not seem obvious to most.

The most important being:

This website is not hosted on a webserver. There is no IIS, no NGINX, no Apache, nothing. There is also no database, no session store, yet the site exists all the same.

Take a trip down memory lane to your highschool days when you learned how to write HTML. You saved the simple text document, and voila! a website! Although your 10 line html file was not very dynamic, it did posses some attributes that are ideal in today's world.

But I digress...

This website was created by [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io), and is entirely comprised of static html files.
